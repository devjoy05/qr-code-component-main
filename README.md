## My process

I used CSS positioning to center my container instead of the much easier methods like flexbox or grid because it's one of the things that I'm still quite confused with and trying to familiarize myself with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
Using transform CSS property and translate function in conjunction with CSS positioning to center a single container on a page.


### Continued development

- Practicing and familiarizing myself more with CSS position, transform property and translate function.
- Creating more responsive design.
