## My process

I used CSS positioning instead of the easier methods like Flexbox or Grid since it's an area I still find quite confusing. It didnâ€™t work initially, but I got it right after remembering to apply the translate function.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
Using transform CSS property and translate function in conjunction with CSS positioning to center a single container on a page.


### Continued development

- Practicing and familiarizing myself more with CSS position, transform property and translate function.
- Creating more responsive design.
